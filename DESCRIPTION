Description: Estimates linear panel event study models. Plots coefficients following the recommendations in Freyaldenhoven et al. (2021). Includes sup-t bands, testing for key hypotheses, least wiggly path through the Wald region. Allows instrumental variables estimation following Freyaldenhoven et al. (2019).
